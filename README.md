# Nederland 3 Roku app

This idea behind this app is to get the full range of the NPO streams to work on the roku.

All content served in the app belongs to NPO. The app is build with the intention to make streaming all NPO channels easier.
To make the content availible we only use the public api documented by the NPO.
There are no intentions to claim any ownership of content provided by the NPO. 
The app is build by the guidelines of all designs allready made by developers for the NPO.
